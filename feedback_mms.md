## Project Workflow

> Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Your project is very clearly scoped and your user stories show that.  You've expressed yourself well in the readme.  I was expecting to see your user stories in the bronze, silver, gold categories, but I like how you did it.

## Technical Requirements

> Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Congratulations.  All the concepts covered during the first few week of WDI are represented.  You have tackled some complex problems.

## Code Quality

> Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Good job. Html is clearly structured. Javascript is extracted into functions with good names.  In the future, I would like to see you grouping functions and variables into objects (encapsulate data and behavior).  We'll be covering more of this during the upcoming lessons.

## Problem Solving

> Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Obviously.
